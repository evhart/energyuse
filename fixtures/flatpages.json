The partners in this project are The Open University, Green Energy Options, University of Sheffield, WAAG Society from the Netherlands, WWF Switzerland, MODUL University in Vienna, and Vienna University of Economics and Business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2) How does EnergyUse&nbsp;work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We learn many things by exchanging experiences in daily life. By&nbsp;sharing online what&nbsp;we learn about our own consumption, we can spread the energy conservation idea to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Periodically, we propose a different topic&nbsp;to be explored by the community. For example, we&nbsp;can discuss together&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">the consumption for preparing your typical breakfast using a&nbsp;toaster, kettle, microwave, etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">If you already own energy monitors, either purchased or received from us, then you can use your smart plugs to measure how much energy is consumed by your individual appliances at home or at work</span>. Once you understand your own consumption and learn how to make smart choices, then you share with other people the things that worked (or didn't!)&nbsp;for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">At any time you can also join existing&nbsp;discussions, support&nbsp;the good suggestions, or add new topics that you believe we should talk about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3) Can I&nbsp;be part of that ?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If you just want to follow the discussions, they are open to everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">But sharing is caring... we want you to&nbsp;join the discussions! &nbsp;To add your contributions,&nbsp;you have to Sign Up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">Currently, only energy meters from Green Energy Options can be directly connected to EnergyUse. If you want to connect your Green Energy Options energy monitors, you have to link your Energynote account (see next question).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If you received the monitors as part of the DecarboNet energy trial, you can easily connect your Energynote account in the Sign Up page. If you have other types of energy monitors from Green Energy Options, then you have to request their access by <a href=\"mailto:energytrialdecarbonet@gmail.com\">email</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4) What is Energynote? Are Energynote and EnergyUse the same thing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><a href=\"https://www.energynote.eu/\">Energynote </a> is an online service provided by Green Energy Options&nbsp;for users of the energy monitors. It brings online the&nbsp;consumption data from the in-home display and also t<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">he on/off status of every appliance connected to a smart plug.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">EnergyUse is this collaboration platform for sharing experiences. Your Energynote account can be connected with the EnergyUse for you to compare your consumption within the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5) How can I apply to receive energy monitors?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">If you live in the UK or Europe (plug adapters are needed in this case), are older than 18 years and have Internet at home with a hub, you can apply to receive the monitoring devices. Fill <a href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/vNsq2GhxFb\">this form </a> to apply. We have a limited number of kits, though. </span><span class=\"s1\">If you are one of the lucky ones, then we'll provide you with&nbsp; an energy monitoring device and a smart plug</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The Ensemble kit by Green Energy Options&nbsp;is composed of: display, sensor to be clipped close to the energy meter, transmitter, Internet bridge, and 1 smart plug. After the study, participants can retain the equipment received. Please note that if you have solar panels or any other type or microgeneration, the Ensemble kit will not be able to obtain the overall consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6) How do I install the monitors?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You have to install the Internet bridge, the in-home display and the smart plug&nbsp;at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;You also need to configure an Energynote account to monitor consumption online. Clipping the sensor and transmitter to monitor the overall consumption in the house is optional.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>\r\nPlease follow these steps to set up your monitors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Step 1&nbsp;</em> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Connect the Internet bridge (square black device) to the black power supply. The device will turn on when you plug it into the mains supply.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Plug one end of the yellow Ethernet cable provided into the back of the Internet bridge and the other into an available port on your Internet router.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Establishing the Internet connection can take several minutes. Please wait for 10 minutes before proceeding to Step 2!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>\r\n<em>Step 2</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp; Follow Steps 1 to 4 of the Quick Start Guide (included in the box).&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Step 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Log on to <a href=\"http://www.energynote.eu/start\"> www.energynote.eu/start </a> to set up your Energynote account.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Click the activation link in the \u201cWelcome to Energynote\u00ae\u201d email to complete your account setup.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You now land on the <a href=\"https://www.energynote.eu/first-setup/\"> First-setup page</a>.
