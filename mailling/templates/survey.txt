Dear {{username}},

We really appreciated your collaboration during our Energy Trial. 

We are on the final sprint of this research, and having your feedback now is really important! - even if you are no longer using the energy monitors.

As a final request, please complete our survey until 30/11/2016:

By completing it, you will be entered into a prize draw for a soft panda toy from World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) or a Â£25 Amazon Voucher. 

And remember you can keep the energy monitoring kit. 

That's our way of expressing our gratitude!

With the best wishes from the DecarboNet team.
