Dear {{username}},

We are happy to announce that EnergyUse (https://energyuse.eu) is now full of new resources for you to spread good energy-saving ideas to the world!
Over the past months, we have worked hard to improve your online experience by adding new features and redesigning EnergyUse.

Now you can see much more on what is going on in the EnergyUse community:
- See who are the top contributors, earn reputation and find conversations more easily.
- Earn badges by participating in the community.
- See recent activities (votes and replies)
- Follow a topic: you can choose the topics you are the most interested in and get notified when new conversations are created.
- Meet the users (users' profiles have pictures from https://gravatar.com/ and richer information)

We hope you will enjoy the new version of EnergyUse and keep enriching the discussions!


* Earth Hour 2016:
DecarboNet (http://decarbonet.org) and Earth Hour (http://earthhour.org) are partners to raise climate change awareness.
Earth Hour 2016 will be held this Saturday 19 March between 8.30PM and 9.30PM.
We invite you to join this global movement and exchange your experience on EnergyUse (https://energyuse.eu/t/earthhour) by creating and contributing to new discussions and tagging them with the 'EarthHour' topic.

* Climate Challenge:
Help tackling Climate Change by playing (you can win a WWF panda bear !)
Climate Challenge is a game designed to increase your literacy about Earth’s climate, test your knowledge against others’, establish conditions to adopt sustainable lifestyle choices, and spread ideas.
By joining the game you are also collaborating with the DecarboNet research!

You can use your Geo Energy monitor to play "against" Climate Change:
